<p> Dear Families, </p>
<p> The Stanford Department of Psychology's Language and Cognition Lab is
planning to conduct a research study on acoustics and child behavior here at
CCSC. The project, led by Michael Frank (faculty in the psychology department
and a CCSC parent/former board member), aims to explore the changing
relationship between acoustics and communication in preschool-age classrooms.
In order to proceed, the researchers are seeking voluntary participation from
parents and children in the LKP and BKP classrooms.
</p>

<p> This study will consist of several components that should not interfere
with typical classroom routines. One of Michael Frank's graduate students will
visit each classroom several times throughout the current school year to
collect sound pressure measurements, audio recordings, and video recordings
of morning activities. The purpose of the recordings is to study children's
interactions and play in the aggregate. Although adult speech and behavior may
also be recorded, it will not be evaluated.
</p>

<p> One of the researchers' primary goals is to protect families' privacy. As such,
the recordings collected in the classroom will remain on a password-protected,
encrypted server, and access is restricted to relevant personnel. No
identifying information will be shared with other parties.
</p>

<p>Your child's participation in the research study will be indirect and is
voluntary. Children will not be asked to complete additional tasks, and will
instead be observed participating in normal classroom activities. Should you
elect to have your child participate in the study, the researchers may observe
some activities in which your child participates. Should you decline
participation in the study, your child will, where possible, not be included in
any recorded observations , and may be asked to briefly move to a different
classroom activity during observation.
</p>

<p>The researchers are thrilled with the possibility of beginning this research
project and believe it will provide valuable insight to CCSC. As such, it has
unanimously received board approval and support from the LKP and BKP teachers.
The researchers appreciate your consideration of being apart of developmental
research!
</p>
